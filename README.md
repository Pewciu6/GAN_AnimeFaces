🎨 Anime Faces Generation with GANs

Generating high-quality anime faces using Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) and Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP)

📝 Project Overview

This project explores two GAN architectures for generating anime faces:

    DCGAN (Baseline)

    WGAN-GP (Improved stability + better results)

Key features:

    🖼️ 10,000+ anime faces trained from scratch.

    📊 Frechet Inception Distance (FID) for quantitative evaluation.

    📈 Loss curves and sample evolution logged every epoch.

Training

    Dataset: Anime Faces (64x64 RGB).

    FID Calculation: Evaluated every 10 epochs.

    Trained for 50 epochs
